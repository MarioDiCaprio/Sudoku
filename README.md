# Sudoku
This project helps you solve Sudoku!

The following features are available (sudoku.py):
- generate a new sudoku to solve
- manually input a sudoku
- solve a given sudoku


As an example, run the following program:
- su = sudoku.Sudoku()
- print(f'Before: \n {su}')
- su.solve()
- print(f'After: \n {su}')


Obviously, doing everything via code is verbose and annoying, so
you can run the GUI implementation of this project (gui.py):
- python gui.py


## Note

In order to run this project, you need to install all packages in
'requirements.txt':
- pip install -r requirements.py
